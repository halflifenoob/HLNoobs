  <h2>Learn to Linux</h2>
  <p><img src="https://hlnoobs.net/images/confusedtux.png" ></p>
  <b>NOTE: This page is a work in progress.<br>Please share this page with anyone who might be affected by the push towards TPM2.0</b>
  <p></p>
  <b>Q: What is Linux?</b>
  <p>A: "Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel" ~ Wikipedia.</p>
  <b>Q: Why should I use linux?</b>
  <p>A: "Its free, more secure then Windows, and once Windows 10's EOL is reached there will either be a shift towards Linux or a massive e-waste crisis will emerge… or maybe both.<br> Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0 which a lot of still perfectly functional PCs do not have.<br> If you have one of these still functioning PCs and don't want it to end up apart of the mass amounts of e-waste then you need to learn how to use Linux now before using Windows 10 becomes a security risk.<br> I set this up as a resource for myself and my Significant Other that is new to Linux but I know this is a issue for a ton of other people." ~ Rizapiza</p>
  <b>About our Linux section.</b>

  <h1>Recommended Distros</h1>
  <p></p>
  <b>Linux Mint:</b>
  <p><a href="https://linuxmint.com/">https://linuxmint.com/</a></p>
  <p>Linux Mint was the distro that made me realize that Linux is a viable alternative to Windows.<br> It is user friendly, comes with plenty of documentation, easy to find community support, and <br> can be used entirely without ever touching a Terminal or CLI (Command Line Interface) application.<br> If you are less tech savvy but still want to get into Linux then this is the perfect one to start with.</p>
  <p></p>
  <b>Debian:</b>
  <p><a href="https://www.debian.org">https://www.debian.org/</a></p>
  <p>This is what I currently use for my desktop AND servers.<br> Debian is what we like to call a base distro which means it is what some other distros use as a base to build upon.<br> Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu and Ubuntu is based on Debian.<br> What does this mean for the average user?<br> It means that if you install this distro you get a very basic and non bloated Linux experience at the cost of it not being easy to understand for new Linux users.<br> You get the choice between multiple different desktop environments so you can customize it to your heart’s content. If you find that you dislike how Windows<br> and more beginner friendly distros try’s to hold your hands through everything and want to learn how to use a terminal then this is the one for you.<br> If you dislike the concept of bleeding edge and much prefer your things stable then this one is very much for you.</p>
  <h1>General Linux Info</h1>
  <b>Linux Journey</b>
  
  <p><a href="https://linuxjourney.com/">https://linuxjourney.com/</a></p>
  <p>This website is a great resource for learning about other popularly used distros if you are not satisfied with the choices above, <br> what things are and why they function, and learning how to use command lines.</p>
  <b>ProtonDB</b>
  <p><a href="https://www.protondb.com/explore">https://www.protondb.com/explore</a></p>
  <p>This website is a essential tool for figuring out Proton Compatibility + checking a Native Linux port's functionality. <br> Use this before buying a game on steam otherwise risk buying something you cannot play.</p>
  
  <h1>Videos and Guides</h1>
  <p>Below you will find guides and videos to teach you the basics needed to use the distros recommend above.<br>
While there are plenty of other functional distros that you should try out eventually,<br>
Mint and Debian are the only ones we can recommend as these two are easy to use when compared to something like Arch + are better environments to adjust to Linux in.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Linux Mint</h2>
  <b>Is Linux Mint BETTER Than Windows?</b>
  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/499jqHWZ-Ts">https://youtu.be/499jqHWZ-Ts</a></p>
  <p>A video meant to help Windows users understand what Linux Mint is and that it gives a very “Windows like” experience.</p>
  <h2>Debian</h2>
  <b>Debian is 30 this year. Here's why it's still worth using.</b>
  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/jhFH03t4HUY">https://youtu.be/jhFH03t4HUY</a></p>
  <p>Veronica Explains (content creator) shows you why Debian is still very much worth considering while explaining that it’s not a “plug and play distro”</p>
