  <h2>How to fix libssl1.0.0:i386 errors on Ubuntu 22.04+ SCDS</h2>
  <p>Guide made by Rizapiza</p>
  <hr>
  <p>This guide is not a fix for the player client error that pops up every time you launch the game on a Linux Distro. This guide is made specifically for dedicated server hosts using Ubuntu 22.04 and above. This is not an issue for Debian 11 from what I have heard but I cannot personally say for sure since I don't host servers with Debian. If this does become a problem for Debian users in the future then this guide should still fix the problem. The issue this guide fixes stems from Canonical not shipping some files in Ubuntu 22.04 (and anything more recent) that are important for SCDS. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INSTALL THESE FILES VIA TERMINAL UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, doing so can break updates on your system which poses a major security risk if you don't know how to fix it. Follow the instructions step by step. Hopefully in the next Sven Coop update this should be fixed since they will be shipping these files in the game files themselves. If you have any questions please ask in the #tech-support channel on the official <a href="https://discord.gg/svencoop">Sven Coop Discord Server</a>. I would answer these questions personally but they are more of experts on this topic then I am and you can potentially get support directly from the SC Devs.</p>
  <hr>
  <p> Step 1: Read through the paragraph above carefully, I am not responsible for you breaking your system or misinterperating what this guide is for.
  <p> Step 2: Double check just in case.
  <p> Step 3: Download the files need via your web browser and the link below. You might have to look carefully for the download link on the page but it's for sure there.
  <p><a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/i386/libssl1.1/download">https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/i386/libssl1.1/download</a>
  <p> Step 4: Open the .deb file file you downloaded with an archive manager. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INSTALL IT, IT WILL BREAK YOUR SYSTEM UPDATES.
  <p> Step 5: Extract the files to a location you can easily access. You should be left with a folder called usr (be careful to not extract it to a location where this can cause issues)
  <p> Step 6: Follow this file path to find the files we need (usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu) They should be called libcrypto.so.1.1 and libssl.so.1.1
  <p> Step 7: In another file manager window open your SCDS root directory. If you are using a VPS or something similar then I expect you to know how to access this already. 
  <p> Step 8: Drop the needed files into your SCDS root directory
  <p> Attempt to launch SCDS the same way you did before following this guide. if you have a new error then it's a step in the right direction but you should get in contact with people on the official sven coop discord server. If you have no errors now then great! You should now be able to connect to your server and enjoy the game.
