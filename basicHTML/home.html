<p>We are here to provide a space within the source (game engines) communities where people can attempt to play without the toxicity.</p>
<p>The base essentials are setup but this website is not finished, stay tuned.</p>
<p>This page is made in only HTML and is kept light in an attempt to let people with really bad connections or old hardware view our info.</p>
<p>If the .gif file below is still loading by the time you've read this, you probably won't have a very fun time trying to play Sven Coop.</p>
<p>Thats not a thing to take as a challenge, Sven is 24 years old as of the time of creating this. It has become better suited for modern systems.</p>
<p>You also need steam running in the background to connect to vac secured servers. If you are unable to connect to steam servers then you</p>
<p>are not able to connect to our servers.</p>
